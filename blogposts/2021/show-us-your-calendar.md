Work is only one part of our lives but until remote work, it occupied a sacrosanct place in our schedules. You were to work between the hours of 9:00 and 5:00, not including your commute to and from the office, and the rest of your life had to flow around that block.

Remote work offers the opportunity to rethink work from first principles and ask ourselves: What does life look like when our jobs work for us, rather than the other way around? When you don’t have to commute, when no one is watching you work, when code shipped at 2 AM is as valuable as code shipped at 10 AM, what can your life become?

This is [r/battlestations](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/) by way of Google Calendar: When your calendar is a creative space, what will you make?

## Loïc Guychard, engineering manager, has a four-day work week

[Loïc Guychard](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/team#lo%C3%AFc-guychard), engineering manager at Sourcegraph, compares work-time to closet space: “If you have it, you’re going to use it. Whether you use it for things that matter, that’s a different story.”

To compress his closet space, Guychard only works four days a week. He works from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM and takes Fridays off. The four-day work week constrains him in a creative way, forcing him to make better decisions with his time.

He’s able to make better decisions partially because his longer weekends give him more energy. “You get a very good reset out of a three day weekend,” he says. Plus, “when I do get to my holiday, I’m not crawling like I used to.”

Guychard extends his flexibility to his reports, arguing that “Input hours are a bad metric for any sort of efficiency.” According to him, “Time-spent-at-desk is the worst measure of efficiency in software engineering. I literally don’t care what hours my reports are working. I just care about output.”

For Guychard, the goal is to maximize output and minimize synchronous work. It’s up to the team to set a “minimum viable guaranteed availability”–outside of that window, he says, work should be entirely flexible.

Guychard believes this so strongly that he’d refuse an offer from a company based on flexibility alone. I asked him to consider an inflexible dream job but he disagreed with the premise: “I doubt that it would be my dream job if it’s completely inflexible.”

Flexibility isn’t just a benefit to be tallied up against other benefits–it says something about your company. “In our industry,” Guychard argues, “if you’re inflexible, you’re ignoring how we actually work and how software actually gets produced. Software is not something that gets produced on an inflexible schedule.”

To be inflexible is to signal your lack of understanding–and in a world where software developers are [increasingly in demand](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) and, as such, increasingly discerning, inflexibility can be a fatal mistake.

## Stephen Gutekanst, software engineer, takes “workations”

[Stephen Gutekanst](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/team#stephen-gutekanst), software engineer at Sourcegraph, gets bored during vacation. As much as he’d like to relax, his distance away from meetings creates the perfect headspace for inspiration. That unique headspace inspired him to make a change.

Every once in a while, on an ad hoc, as needed basis, Gutekanst marks a vacation in his calendar, turns off Slack and Zoom, and focuses entirely on coding–for as much as two weeks at a time.

The workplace can get noisy. For Gutekanst, it comes in waves.

Over the course of two months, he says, half of his time might go toward helping other people: “It’s a weird conundrum because it’s a completely useful way to spend my time. On the other hand, it’s completely unrelated to what my focus area actually is, which is like working on a product feature or something like that.”

![alt_text](images/image1.png 'image_tooltip')

Part of the reason for that comes from working at a [high-growth startu](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/announcing-sourcegraphs-series-d-round/)p: “A lot of the time, we don’t have an owner for an area and I’m the person with the most context, so it’s useful for me to help out there.”

It’s useful, he says, but also a dangerous temptation: “It’s really tempting, as an engineer, to say ‘Yeah, this is the main thing I’m working on but oh, this person needs help or someone has a question, let me jump in and help them.’ You can end up losing context a lot of the time.”

Workations are a way to combat distractions and regain focus. To make them work, Gutekanst builds a clear consensus about what he’s doing and about what others expect him to do. “I know what I need to work on, I just need the time to go and do it. In those situations, detaching from everything else can be really powerful.”

He takes a workcation “whenever there’s a time where I’m like ‘hey, I’d love to just sit down and write this code for a while.’” The result is a situation “where you can completely focus and get a lot done.”

## Vanesa Ortiz, community advocate, works 32 hours per week

“My code quality declined. My code reviews became longer. It was harder and harder for me to focus properly and reach my goals.”

[Vanesa Ortiz](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/team#vanesa-ortiz-she-her), community advocate at Sourcegraph and former co-host of [Dev Tool Time](https://info.sourcegraph.com/dev-tool-time), had brain fog. When she came back from maternity leave, she struggled to code the way she used to be able to. “I couldn’t focus correctly,” she said. “I felt like I was constantly deprived, which is literally what happens when you’re a milk factory 24/7.”

Brain fog, or “mom brain” happens to many mothers post-pregnancy ([some research](https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/my-body/postpartum/mommy-brain-yes-its-a-thing/) points toward the cause being temporary brain contraction). Ortiz was struggling to juggle a full time job, a new baby, and her portion of the household work. Weekends were no longer a space for recovery; they became stressful days for housework and childcare: “I was exhausted after the weekend.”

Together, Ortiz and her then engineering manager decided to try a four day work week–it was an immediate success. Communicating the change to her team only required marking the time in Google Calendar and the occasional reminder that she was unavailable for a meeting. The schedule served her during her time as an engineer and she’s maintained it since becoming a community advocate.

Now, she has the time she needs: “On the weekend I get to enjoy my children. It’s not like I’m trying to push them away as I deal with household chores.” The success of her new schedule has lasted through to her second child. “I can’t imagine going back,” she says, “especially with the second kid.”

Ortiz recommends the four-day work week to everyone, but especially to primary caretakers: “If you are struggling with work/life balance, and you need that extra time to practice self care and to deal with all the messes in your life, then it should really be considered.”

## TJ DeVries, software engineer, streams on Fridays

[TJ DeVries](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/team#tj-devries), software engineer at Sourcegraph and core maintainer for open source Vim-based text editor [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), streams almost all day every Friday. How? He works four tens: four days a week, ten hours each.

DeVries acknowledges it’s not his _ideal_ schedule. “My preferred hours would be working in the middle of the night but that doesn’t work with a family,” he says, laughing. DeVries has an 11-month-old baby boy, a wife, and responsibilities at church: all of which make weeknights busy. Working four tens allows him to handle those responsibilities at night and have Friday free for streaming his [live coding sessions](https://www.twitch.tv/teej_dv).

<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image2.png 'image_tooltip')

Many would rightfully worry that lopping off one day a week wouldn’t sit well with a manager. DeVries had the opposite experience: “No one cares about how you’re working as long as you’re getting done what you say you’re going to get done.” As long as his new schedule wasn’t a detriment to his team, DeVries says, then he had his manager’s full support.

DeVries is frank: “I could work in the middle of the night for two nights a week and if I ship all the same amount of stuff, I don’t think people would care.” Though they might reach out about his health if it looked like he weren’t sleeping, otherwise, his manager and his team just care about output.

DeVries is careful to note that there’s a big difference between tolerating someone on your time working different hours and actually supporting them. It’s important to him that no one makes him feel weird and no one resents him. He has, and is very grateful for, his agency. It allows him to work full time hours and put all the effort he wants into his hobby. And his audience is grateful, too.

## Robert Lin, software engineer, has a split schedule

[Robert Lin](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/team#robert-lin), software engineer at Sourcegraph, likes bouldering and hates queues.

“For some activities,” he says, “you just can’t do them at night. And if you do it on weekends, then you’re competing with all these people who want to do the same thing on their two days off.”

Lin works a split schedule, meaning that for three days a week, he works from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM. On the other two days, he works a normal 9:00 to 5:00.

Lin is used to some degree of flexibility. When he and his partner were students, they optimized their schedules for their primary hobbies–bouldering being number one. Lin decided he didn’t want to change that as he started working full time.

When he onboarded with Sourcegraph, there was nothing that said he had to be working from 9:00 to 5:00 so he set his schedule how he wanted it. “I don’t think there was any particular response to it,” he said. “I was lucky,” he notes, too, “to be on a pretty meeting-light team to start with.”

Lin is wary of the exhaustion that can come with a traditional schedule. “There’s something about 9:00-5:00 that’s kind of exhausting,” he said. “What would often happen is you’d charge through the day and then you’d get home at the end of the workday, maybe hit the gym for a while, come back and cook dinner–and that’s pretty much your whole day. There’s no room for anything else.”

Work is important to Lin but it isn’t his life–it’s just part of it: “The key thing for me is being able to structure work around things I want to do. That is super liberating.”

Lin recommends building a company culture that prizes independence. A company culture where everyone needs everyone else to do anything is one that can’t accommodate different schedules. Lin says the first step to experimenting with flexibility is to “build up a culture on your team where everyone isn’t tightly interdependent.” It needs to be a foregone conclusion that “you’re not 100% available all the time.”

## Jean du Plessis, director of engineering, has a nonlinear workday

[Jean du Plessis](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/company/team#jean-du-plessis-he-him), a director of engineering at Sourcegraph, considers his calendar “an experimentation over a long period of time.” Located in South Africa, du Plessis has reports all over Europe, Asia, and both coasts of North America. “I have a big time frame to cover,” he says.

The nonlinear workday, [according to GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/non-linear-workday/), the company who popularized the term, “decouples time from work and acts as a forcing function to embrace asynchronous workflows.”

For du Plessis, this means using the morning to take care of the chores that most would do after work, such as grocery shopping and walking the dog. From the late morning to the afternoon, he focuses on meetings with his teammates and completing work leftover from the previous day.

In the afternoon, du Plessis is frank: he might just nap. 3:00 PM (his time) is when most people in the east coast of the United States start to wake up, so the next three hours have some of the best overlap for meetings. From 6:00 PM to 8:30 PM is family time: “We have supper together, kids get bathed, we read a story.” And from 8:30 PM to 10:00 PM, he handles any stray follow-up meetings and completes some light work.

<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image3.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

![alt_text](images/image3.png 'image_tooltip')

For du Plessis, the nonlinear work day isn’t merely a traditional workday, fragmented: “I’m picky about what I do in the evenings.” He tends to schedule meetings that he doesn’t have to lead during his evening sessions; meetings where he only has to listen or provide input. He optimizes his entire day based on what he does best when.

And that includes rest: “Friday is my recovery day,” he says. “If I felt like I put in a lot of effort on the days leading up to Friday, I’ll take Friday easy. I’ve found myself playing video games in the afternoon and I’ve found myself meeting up with friends.”

One benefit of the traditional 9:00 to 5:00 is that some sense of work/life balance is built into its limited 40 hours. Even still, many people find themselves burnt out. Does a nonlinear day threaten to make this even worse, given the potential for even more hours worked?

Not for du Plessis. “For me,” he says, “maintaining a healthy work/life balance isn’t about the time. It’s about how I feel: does my work let me focus on my personal life when I need to? Does my personal life allow me to focus on my work when I need to? Are the stakeholders in my life, my personal and my work life, feeling like their needs are met?”

If the answers to these questions are “yes,” “yes,” and “yes,” then du Plessis feels balanced. And for him, a nonlinear workday makes it easier to keep answering “yes.”

## How to become more flexible

### Experiment

The calendar you inherit, the calendar you’ve always used, isn’t the calendar you have to keep using–even if you change it. “Don’t stop experimenting,” advises du Plessis. “Be open to trying something new and seeing how you feel about it. Most importantly, if you are going to do something that’s different from the norm, think about how it’s going to impact someone else.” He emphasizes that “someone else” includes your family as much as it does your coworkers.

### Iterate

Don’t waterfall your calendar. You can do as much introspection as you want, but it’s going to be difficult to figure out what works best for you until you try. “It’s unlikely that you’ll know the optimal schedule ahead of time,” DeVries warns. “That’s not usually how we find the best version of something. We iterate on it over time.” So, try something. See if it works. Improve on it and try something else.

### Make small changes

The 9:00 to 5:00 schedule has the benefit of tradition. No one is going to question you for working “normal” hours. But when you start messing with your schedule, it can be hard to judge whether you’ve made the right decision or not. Du Plessis doesn’t recommend making wholesale changes for that reason. Instead, he says, “Make small changes at a time. Make a change and try it. If it works, adopt it.” Most importantly, he says, be specific about how you’re going to determine a change’s success.

### Don’t overthink your calendar

This article has thrown a lot of ideas at you but Guychard recommends one thing: “Don’t overthink it until you’re familiar with the nature of your job.” Before you experiment, understand the time commitment you need to be efficient. Do you need three-hour focus blocks? Do you prefer to work in thirty-minute increments? How much do you mind interruptions? Identify what’s important to you when it comes to meeting your SLAs and feeling efficient, Guychard says. Only when you understand yourself can you experiment confidently. And even when you do understand, or think you understand, remember that nothing is permanent: “It’s a fluid thing,” Guychard says. “Whatever you do can be reverted.”

## Get creative with your calendar

Whether you’ve worked remotely and flexibly for decades, or just started after this recent wave of remote work, now is the time to reconsider your calendar.

The 40 hour work week is a [relic of the late 1800s](https://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-the-40-hour-workweek-2015-10), a right hard won by labor organizers but not a tradition we should hew to unthinkingly. Since then, we have moved from economies primarily defined by widgets produced to economies primarily defined by knowledge work.

In this brave (not so new) world, time-input is not an effective way to measure productivity, nor an effective way to structure your life. If you have the privilege of remote, flexible work, take the time to rethink your calendar and see how best it can work for you, your family, and your life.

## Vanesa Ortiz, community advocate, works 32 hours per week

“My code quality declined. My code reviews became longer. It was harder and harder for me to focus properly and reach my goals.”

Vanesa Ortiz, community advocate at Sourcegraph and former co-host of [Dev Tool Time](https://info.sourcegraph.com/dev-tool-time), had brain fog. When she came back from maternity leave, she struggled to code the way she used to be able to. “I couldn’t focus correctly,” she said. “I felt like I was constantly deprived, which is literally what happens when you’re a milk factory 24/7.”

Brain fog, or “mom brain” happens to many mothers post-pregnancy ([some research](https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/my-body/postpartum/mommy-brain-yes-its-a-thing/) points toward the cause being temporary brain contraction).

Ortiz is careful to note, however, that anyone considering changing their schedule needs to do a cost benefit analysis. Ortiz works 32 hours across 4 days instead of 40, meaning she has to consider the consequences of working part time. As much as she loves her schedule, she recommends taking account of the costs: “Consider the fact that, realistically, it will slow down your career path a little bit.” Sacrificing one day a week may be the best choice for your life, but being ⅕ less available than your coworkers will affect your career “one way or another.”

## Jean du Plessis, engineering manager, has a nonlinear workday

Jean du Plessis, an engineering manager at Sourcegraph, considers his calendar “an experimentation over a long period of time.” Located in South Africa, du Plessis has reports all over Europe, Asia, and both coasts of North America. “I have a big time frame to cover,” he says.

The nonlinear workday, [according to GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/non-linear-workday/), the company who popularized the term, “decouples time from work and acts as a forcing function to embrace asynchronous workflows.”

From 6:00 PM to 8:30 PM is family time: “We have supper together, kids get bathed, we read a story.” And from 8:30 PM to 10:00 PM, he handles any stray follow-up meetings and completes some light work.

![alt_text](images/image6.png 'image_tooltip')

For du Plessis, the nonlinear work day isn’t merely a traditional workday, fragmented: “I’m picky about what I do in the evenings.” He tends to schedule meetings that he doesn’t have to lead during his evening sessions; meetings where he only has to listen or provide input. He optimizes his entire day based on what he does best when.

And that includes rest: “Friday is my recovery day,” he says. “If I felt like I put in a lot of effort on the days leading up to Friday, I’ll take Friday easy. I’ve found myself playing video games in the afternoon and I’ve found myself meeting up with friends.”

One benefit of the traditional 9:00 to 5:00 is that some sense of work/life balance is built into its limited 40 hours. Even still, many people find themselves burnt out. Does a nonlinear day threaten to make this even worse, given the potential for even more hours worked?

Not for du Plessis. “For me,” he says, “maintaining a healthy work/life balance isn’t about the time. It’s about how I feel: does my work let me focus on my personal life when I need to? Does my personal life allow me to focus on my work when I need to? Are the stakeholders in my life, my personal and my work life, feeling like their needs are met?”

If the answers to these questions are “yes,” “yes,” and “yes,” then du Plessis feels balanced. And for him, a nonlinear workday makes it easier to keep answering “yes.”

### Make small changes

The 9:00 to 5:00 schedule has the benefit of tradition. No one is going to question you for working “normal” hours. But when you start messing with your schedule, it can be hard to judge whether you’ve made the right decision or not. Du Plessis doesn’t recommend making wholesale changes for that reason. Instead, he says, “Make small changes at a time. Make a change and try it. If it works, adopt it.” Most importantly, he says, be specific about how you’re going to determine a change’s success.

### Change your mindset

Your ability to be creative with your schedule will shift depending on what questions you can ask yourself. Lin recommends you ask “How do I get good work done?” instead of “how do I fulfil this expectation?” or “how do I make myself look like I’m fulfilling this expectation?” According to him, “All this is mindset.” And if you change your mindset, your calendar will follow.

### Do a cost-benefit analysis

Ortiz, unlike DeVries or Guychard, works 32 hours across 4 days instead of 40, meaning she has to consider the consequences of working part time. As much as she loves her schedule, she recommends taking account of the costs: “Consider the fact that, realistically, it will slow down your career path a little bit.” Sacrificing one day a week may be the best choice for your life, but being ⅕ less available than your coworkers will affect your career “one way or another.”

### Don’t overthink your calendar

This article has thrown a lot of ideas at you but Guychard recommends one thing: “Don’t overthink it until you’re familiar with the nature of your job.” Before you experiment, understand the time commitment you need to be efficient. Do you need three-hour focus blocks? Do you prefer to work in thirty-minute increments? How much do you mind interruptions? Identify what’s important to you when it comes to meeting your SLAs and feeling efficient, Guychard says. Only when you understand yourself can you experiment confidently. And even when you do understand, or think you understand, remember that nothing is permanent: “It’s a fluid thing,” Guychard says. “Whatever you do can be reverted.”

## Get creative with your calendar

Whether you’ve worked remotely and flexibly for decades, or just started after this recent wave of remote work, now is the time to reconsider your calendar.

The 40 hour work week is a [relic of the late 1800s](https://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-the-40-hour-workweek-2015-10), a right hard won by labor organizers but not a tradition we should hew to unthinkingly. Since then, we have moved from economies primarily defined by widgets produced to economies primarily defined by knowledge work.

In this brave (not so new) world, time-input is not an effective way to measure productivity, nor an effective way to structure your life. If you have the privilege of remote, flexible work, take the time to rethink your calendar and see how best it can work for you, your family, and your life.

# Show Us Your Calendar (V1 )

Your dream job comes through your LinkedIn. It pays better than your current job and the benefits are amazing. One catch: they want you to work 9:00-5:00––no flexibility and no exceptions. Would you change jobs?

“No.” That was the answer Jean du Plessis, engineering manager here at Sourcegraph, provided me when I asked him that question.

Plessis works a nonlinear workday, meaning that for him, the day starts at around 7:30, breaks for an afternoon nap, and picks up again in the evening after his kids are in bed. For Plessis, the ability to work this way is not only a benefit to his personal life and his work life, but is a sign that a company has a good culture.

Remote work (the “new normal,” if you haven’t heard) is the great enabler of schedules like Plessis’s. Not every remote company allows this level of flexibility but most in-office companies, due to the incentives of commercial rent and butts-in-seat management styles, means that this flexibility is largely only found in remote companies.

According to a [Digital Ocean survey](https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/currents-july2019/) (conducted pre-pandemic), 86% of developers currently work remotely in some capacity and almost 1/3 work from home full time. Importantly, and we can only assume this has increased parallel to greater remote work availability, 43% of developers say “the ability to work remotely is a must-have when considering an offer with a company.”

Developers are no longer unique: According to [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/12/09/how-the-coronavirus-outbreak-has-and-hasnt-changed-the-way-americans-work/), about one fifth of American workers worked from home all or most of the time prior to COVID-19. As the pandemic swept across the country and the world, however, 71% of those workers reported doing their work from home all or most of the time. And most want to remain at home: According to [PwC research](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/us-remote-work-survey.html), 55% of employees would prefer to work remotely at least three days a week.

Developers know better than anyone how revolutionary remote work can be. As such, we turned to our developers to learn what happens when you embrace remote work and all the flexibility it entails. It starts with their calendars.

For most people, a calendar is but a bucket of meetings; for these developers, the calendar is a dynamic, creative space–one that they can bend, shape, and mold to their liking. If you’re new to remote or asynchronous work––or new to rethinking either from first principles––then these are the people to learn from.

## Robert Lin has a split schedule

Robert Lin, software engineer at Sourcegraph, likes bouldering and hates lines.

“For some activities,” he says, “you just can’t do them at night. And if you do it on weekends, then you’re competing with all these people who want to do the same thing on their two days off.”

Lin works a split schedule, meaning that for three days a week, he works from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM. On the other two days, he works a normal 9:00 to 5:00.

Lin is used to some degree of flexibility. When he and his partner were students, they optimized their schedules for their primary hobbies–bouldering being number one. Lin decided he didn’t want to change as he started working full time.

When he onboarded with Sourcegraph, there was nothing that said he had to be working from 9:00 to 5:00 so he set his schedule how wanted it. “I don’t think there was any particular response to it,” he said. “I was lucky,” he notes, too, “to be on a pretty meeting-light team to start with.”

Lin is wary of the exhaustion that can come with a traditional schedule. “There’s something about 9:00-5:00 that’s kind of exhausting,” he said. “What would often happen is you’d charge through the day and then you’d get home at the end of the workday, maybe hit the gym for a while, come back and cook dinner–and that’s pretty much your whole day. There’s no room for anything else.”

Work is important to Lin but it isn’t his life–it’s just part of it: “The key thing for me is being able to structure work around things I want to do. That is super liberating.”

## Jean du Plessis has a nonlinear workday

Jean du Plessis, an engineering manager at Sourcegraph, considers his calendar “an experimentation over a long period of time.” Located in South Africa, du Plessis has reports all over Europe, Asia, and both coasts of North America. “I have a big time frame to cover,” he says.

The nonlinear workday, [according to Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/non-linear-workday/), the company who popularized the term, “decouples time from work and acts as a forcing function to embrace asynchronous workflows.”

For du Plessis, this means using the morning to take care of the chores that most would do after work, such as grocery shopping and walking the dog. From the late morning to the afternoon, he focuses on meetings with his teammates and completing work leftover from the previous day.

In the afternoon, du Plessis is frank: he might just nap. 3:00 PM (his time) is when most people in the east coast of the United States start to wake up, so the next three hours have some of the best overlap for meetings. From 6:00 to 8:30 is family time: “We have supper together, kids get bathed, we read a story.” And from 8:30 to 10:00, he handles any stray follow up meetings and completes some light work.

For du Plessis, the nonlinear work day isn’t merely a traditional workday, fragmented: “I’m picky about what I do in the evenings.” He tends to schedule meetings he doesn’t have to lead during his evening sessions, meetings where he only has to listen or provide input. He optimizes his entire day based on what he does best when.

And that includes rest: “Friday is my recovery day,” he says. “If I felt like I put in a lot of effort on the days leading up to Friday, I’ll take Friday easy. I’ve found myself playing video games in the afternoon and I’ve found myself meeting up with friends.”

One benefit of the traditional 9:00 to 5:00 is that some sense of work/life balance is built into its limited 40 hours. Even still, many people find themselves burnt out. Does a nonlinear day threaten to make this even worse, given the potential for even more hours worked?

Not for du Plessis. “For me,” he says, “maintaining a healthy work/life balance isn’t about the time. It’s about how I feel: does my work let me focus on my personal life when I need to? Does my personal life allow me to focus on my work when I need to? Does my personal life allow me to focus on my work when I need to? Are the stakeholders in my life, my personal and my work life, feeling like their needs are met?”

If the answers to these questions are yes, yes, and yes, then du Plessis feels balanced. And for him, a nonlinear workday makes it easier to keep answering yes.

## Loïc Guychard has a four day work week

Loïc Guychard, engineering manager at Sourcegraph, compares work time to closet space: “if you have it, you’re going to use it. Whether you use it for things that matter, that’s a different story.”

To compress his closet space, Guychard only works four days a week. He works from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM and takes Fridays off. The four day work week constrains him in a creative way, forcing him to make better decisions with his time.

He’s able to make better decisions partially because his longer weekends give him more energy. “You get a very good reset out of a three day weekend,” he says. Plus, “when I do get to my holiday, I’m not crawling like I used to.”

Guychard extends his flexibility to his reports, arguing that “Input hours are a bad metric for any sort of efficiency.” According to him, “Time-spent-at-desk is the worst measure of efficiency in software engineering. I literally don’t care what hours my reports are working. I just care about output.”

For Guychard, the goal is to maximize output and minimize synchronous work. It’s up to the team to set a “minimum viable guaranteed availability”–outside of that window, he says, work should be entirely flexible.

Guychard believes this so strongly that he’d refuse an offer from a company based on flexibility alone. I asked him to consider an inflexible dream job but he disagreed with the premise: “I doubt that it would be my dream job if it’s completely inflexible.”

Flexibility isn’t just a benefit to be tallied up against other benefits–it says something about your company. “In our industry,” Guychard argues, “if you’re inflexible, you’re ignoring how we actually work and how software actually gets produced. Software is not something that gets produced on an inflexible schedule.”

To be inflexible is to signal your lack of understanding–and in a world where software developers are [increasingly in demand](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) and, as such, increasingly discerning, inflexibility can be a fatal mistake.

## TJ DeVries streams on Fridays

TJ DeVries, software engineer at Sourcegraph and core maintainer for open-source Vim-based text editor [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), streams almost all day every Friday. How? He works four tens: four days a week, ten hours each.

That said, DeVries acknowledges it’s not his ideal schedule. “My preferred hours would be working in the middle of the night but that doesn’t work with a family,” he says, laughing. DeVries has an 11-month-old baby boy, a wife, and responsibilities at church: all of which make weeknights busy. Working four tens allows him to handle those responsibilities at night and have Friday free for streaming his live coding.

Many would rightfully worry that lopping off one day a week wouldn’t sit well with a manager. DeVries had the opposite experience: “No one cares about how you’re working as long as you’re getting done what you say you’re going to get done.” As long as his new schedule wasn’t a detriment to his team, DeVries says, then he had his manager’s full support.

DeVries is frank: “I could work in the middle of the night for two nights a week and if I ship all the same amount of stuff, I don’t think people would care.” Though they might reach out about his health if it looked like he weren’t sleeping, otherwise, his manager and his team just care about output.

DeVries is careful to note that there’s a big difference between tolerating someone on your time working different hours and actually supporting them. It’s important to him that no one makes him feel weird and no one resents him. He has, and is very grateful for, his agency. It allows him to work full time hours and put all the effort he wants into his hobby. And his audience is grateful, too.

## Stephen Gutekanst takes “workcations”

Stephen Gutekanst gets bored during vacation. As much as he’d like to relax, his distance away from meetings and noise creates the perfect headspace for inspiration. That unique headspace inspired him to make a change.

Every once in a while, on an ad hoc, as needed basis, Gutekanst marks a vacation in his calendar, turns off Slack and Zoom, and focuses entirely on coding–for as much as two weeks at a time.

The workplace can get noisy. For Gutekanst, it comes in waves.

Over the course of 2 months, he says, half of his time might go toward helping other people: “It’s a weird conundrum because it’s a completely useful way to spend my time. On the other hand, it’s completely unrelated to what my focus area actually is, which is like working on a product feature or something like that.”

Part of the reason for that comes from working at a high-growth startup: “A lot of the time, we don’t have an owner for an area and I’m the person with the most context, so it’s useful for me to help out there.”

It’s useful, he says, but also a dangerous temptation: “It’s really tempting, as an engineer, to say ‘yeah, this is the main thing I’m working on but ‘oh, this person needs help or someone has a question, let me jump in and help them.’ You can end up losing context a lot of the time.”

Workcations are a way to combat distractions and regain focus. To make them work, Gutekanst builds a clear consensus about what he’s doing and about what others expect him to do. “I know what I need to work on, I just need the time to go and do it. In those situations, detaching from everything else can be really powerful.”

He takes a workcation “whenever there’s a time where I’m like ‘hey, I’d love to just sit down and write this code for a while.’” The result is a situation “where you can completely focus and get a lot done.”

## Vanesa Ortiz works 32 hours per week

“My code quality declined. My code reviews became longer. It was harder and harder for me to focus properly and reach my goals.”

Vanesa Ortiz, community advocate at Sourcegraph, had brain fog. When she came back from maternity leave, she struggled to code the way she used to be able to. “I couldn’t focus correctly,” she said. “I felt like I was constantly deprived, which is literally what happens when you’re a milk factory 24/7.”

Brain fog, or “mom brain” happens to many mothers post-pregnancy ([some research](https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/my-body/postpartum/mommy-brain-yes-its-a-thing/) points toward the cause being temporary brain contraction). Ortiz was struggling to juggle a full time job, a new baby, and her portion of the household work. Weekends were no longer a space for recovery; they became stressful days for housework and childcare: “I was exhausted after the weekend.”

Together, Ortiz and her engineering manager decided to try a four day work week–it was an immediate success. Communicating the change to her team only required marking the time in Google Calendar and the occasional reminder that she was unavailable for a meeting.

Now, she has the time she needs: “On the weekend I get to enjoy my children. It’s not like I’m trying to push them away as I deal with household chores.” The success of her new schedule has lasted through to her second child. “I can’t imagine going back,” she says, “especially with the second kid.”

Ortiz recommends the four way work week to everyone, but especially to primary caretakers: “If you are struggling with work/life balance, and you need that extra time to practice self care and to deal with all the messes in your life, then it should really be considered.”

## How to (actually) become more flexible

### Build an independent culture

A company culture where everyone needs everyone else to do anything is one that can’t accommodate different schedules. Lin says the first step to experimenting with flexibility is to “build up a culture on your team where everyone isn’t tightly interdependent.” It needs to be a foregone conclusion that “you’re not 100% available all the time.”

### Change your mindset

Your ability to be creative with your schedule will shift depending on what questions you can ask yourself. Lin recommends you ask “How do I get good work done?” instead of “how do I fulfil this expectation?” or “how do I make myself look like I’m fulfilling this expectation?” According to him, “All this is mindset.” And if you change your mindset, your calendar will follow.

### Experiment

The calendar you inherit, the calendar you’ve always used, isn’t the calendar you have to keep using–even if you do something radical. “Don’t stop experimenting,” advises du Plessis. “Be open to trying something new and seeing how you feel about it. Most importantly, if you are going to do something that’s different from the norm, think about how it’s going to impact someone else.” He emphasizes that “someone else” includes your family as much as it does your coworkers.

### Make small changes

The 9:00 to 5:00 schedule has the benefit of tradition. No one is going to question you for working “normal” hours. But when you start messing with your schedule, it can be hard to judge whether you’ve made the right decision or not. Du Plessis doesn’t recommend making wholesale changes for that reason. Instead, he says, “Make small changes at a time. Make a change and try it. If it works, adopt it.” Most importantly, he says, be specific about how you’re going to determine a change’s success.

### Iterate

Don’t waterfall your calendar. You can do as much introspection as you want, but it’s going to be difficult to figure out what works best for you until you try. “It’s unlikely that you’ll know the optimal schedule ahead of time,” DeVries warns. “That’s not usually how we find the best version of something. We iterate on it over time.” So, try something. See if it works. Improve on it and try something else.

### Do a cost-benefit analysis

Ortiz, unlike DeVries or Guychard, works 32 hours across 4 days instead of 40, meaning she has to consider the consequences of working part time. As much as she loves her schedule, she recommends taking account of the costs: “Consider the fact that, realistically, it will slow down your career path a little bit.” Sacrificing one day a week may be the best choice for your life, but being ⅕ less available than your coworkers will affect your career “one way or another.”

### Don’t overthink your calendar

Do you need three-hour focus blocks? Do you prefer to work in thirty-minute increments? How much do you mind interruptions? Identify what’s important to you when it comes to meeting your SLAs and feeling efficient, Guychard says. Only when you understand yourself can you experiment confidently. And even when you do understand, or think you understand, remember that nothing is permanent: “It’s a fluid thing,” Guychard says. “Whatever you do can be reverted.”

## Get creative with your calendar

Whether you’ve worked remotely and flexibly for decades, or just started after this recent wave of remote work, now is the time to reconsider your calendar.

The 40 hour work week is a [relic of the late 1800s](https://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-the-40-hour-workweek-2015-10), a right hard won by labor organizers but not a tradition we should hew to unthinkingly.

## Notes

Robert Lin, software engineer

- Experience flexing schedule around freelance work and student work
- When he and his partner had classes, they would schedule them such that they had one day free for their hobbies––for them, it was bouldering.
- “For some activities, you just can’t do them at night. And if you do it on weekends, then you’re competing with all these people who want to do the same thing on their two days off.”
- Started as crowd avoidance
- 3 days a week:
  - 8 AM to noon
  - 6 PM to 10/11
- 2 days a week: normal 9-5
- “I don’t think there was any particular response to it.”
- There was nothing that said he had to be 9-5 so he set up his schedule how he wanted it.
- “I was lucky to be on a pretty meeting-light team to start with.”
- Team requires independence because it’s globally distributed
- Still able to drop into impromptu calls in the mornings and normal days
- Moved to Taiwan, changed schedule to maximize overlap
  - 7-11
  - 7-11
  - Quiet, no one was online. Made it almost impossible to join meetings.
  - “They ran into an issue late in the day and were able to pass it off to me as he was logging off and as I was waking up.” Would wake up, get a debrief, and he’d log off. And vice versa
  - “It sets a precedent that you aren’t dependent on your timezones overlapping.”
  - “In Taiwan,” where, Lin says, the work culture is more traditional, “they’re unsure how to exhibit their value if they’re not doing visible work. They’ll ask: how do you make sure your manager knows you’re working when you’re not in front of them 9-5?”
- Focus time in the evenings “away from some of the noise”
- Many people find remote work difficult because of the near-constant Slack and Gmail pings, but he finds it easy: “Almost too easy, sometimes” he says. He’s found himself prone to tuning out for focus work and returning to a disaster. “Oh no, what did I miss here?”
- He had a “very flexible” split work day, letting things run into the afternoon as needed.
- “There are definitely days where I run over eight hours but it’s not the norm.” There are urgent problems that make you want to run over to stay on those tickets.
- “Just because split days have a lot of advantages, it doesn’t you have to split day all the time. I do like occasional 9-5s. Sometimes you get a coffee and charge through the whole day and relax in the evenings. It’s nice to mix it up.”
- “The novelty is great.”
- “The key thing for me is being able to structure work around things I want to do. That is super liberating.”
- “There’s something about 9-5 that’s kind of exhausting. What would often happen is you’d charge through the day and then you’d get home at the end of the workday, maybe hit the gym for a while, come back and cook dinner––and that’s pretty much your whole day. There’s no room for anything else.”
- Visit his grandparents, spend time with family, hobbies
- Offsets
  - Weekends were Friday and Saturday instead of Saturdat and Sunday
  - Another way to focus on Sunday and free time on Friday
- The first step: “Build up a culture on your team where everyone isn’t tightly interdependent.”
  - Build it into team culture that “you’re not 100% available all the time”
  - “Results-oriented work environment.”
- “Having that be a requirement says something about how a team operates. You’re expected to be 100% online. That probably means the work culture is filled with meetings and lots of interdependency, and an expectation that if you have a problem, you have to ask why, you can’t figure it out on your own.” “That's a red flag for me.”
- “All this is mindset: ask a question like ‘how do I get good work done?’ instead of ‘how do I fulfil this expectation?’ or ‘how do I make myself look like I’m fulfilling this expectation?’”
- “There are moments where I get super doubtful if I’m doing what’s expected or if I’m doing enough.” Especially when he sees action on slack during his afternoons off. “Those doubts still linger.”
- “You have to feel supported by your manager and your culture.”

Jean du Plessis, engineering manager

- Located in South Africa, UTC+2, reports in Europe, Americans on both coasts, Russia. “I have a big time frame to cover.”
- Starts late in morning doing things people would normally do after work, such as grocery shopping and walking the dog
- Morning to afternoon session that focuses on meeting teammates, work from previous day
- Afternoon nap, depending on how late he was up previous evening. 2:00 his time
- 3:00 is when east coast US wake up, 3-6 more meetings, most favorable overlap
- 6-8:30 family time. “We have supper together, kids get bathed, we read a story.”
- 8:30-10:00: follow up meetings, light work
- “I tend to schedule meetings I don’t have to lead during my evening session. It’s easy not to be at your best late in the evening.” Listen, provide input or guidance. “I’m picky about what I do in the evenings.”
- “My manager doesn’t manage my performance based on what I’ve put in.”
- No meetings Fridays. Stops at second stint, no evening. Default no meeting
- “Friday is my recovery day.” “If I felt like I put in a lot of effort on the days leading up to the Friday, I’ll take Friday easy. I’ve found myself playing video games in the afternoon, at times I’ve found myself meeting up with friends.” “Friday is essentially my buffer day to help me retain the balance.”
- He doesn’t track time. “For me, maintaining a healthy work life balance isn’t about the time. It’s about how I feel: does my work let me focus on my personal life when I need to? Does my personal life allow me to focus on my work when I need to? Are the stakeholders in my life, my personal and my work life, feeling like their needs are met?”
- “What inspired me was the need to be available for my team.”
- Certain things that async doesn’t work for: 1:1s and similar meetings that benefit from face to face communication.
- “No one is pressuring me to be on late. This is a choice I’m making. I spoke with my wife about it. It works for our family. I don’t advocate my schedule as the golden rule. I advocate trying something else and not having a fixed mindset of 9-5.”
- “I realized I’m not as much of a morning person as I used to be–or maybe I’m getting older.”
- “It feels like I’m there for my team and the people who depend on me.”
- “My manager gave me agency to try whatever works for me.”
- He informed his team so they got the right message: they don’t have to work late. That’s not expected of them
- “I always like to experiment.”
- “What I like to do is delete meetings off my calendar.” Do it async instead
- “My calendar is an experimentation over a long period of time.”
- Context switching group lots of similar things together
  - Schedule all 1:1s on Wednesays
  - Every fourth thursday is all skip level meetings
  - “I try to stay in the same mindset in terms of how I’m operating.” “It allows you to have to jump less in your mind.”
  - “Because I’m an introvert and talking to people is draining, I schedule some recovery time at key points in the day to disconnect.”
  - “I do like starting my day knowing the theme for this day is this or that.”
- “Make small changes at a time. Make on change and try it. If it works, adopt it. I don’t recommend making wholesale changes.” “Be specific about how you’re going to judge whether it’s successful.”
- Tried four days a week but it didn’t feel nice not being available on Fridays, prefers to use it as a buffer day
- “I don’t recommend it for anybody apart from myself because it works for me. I recommend they try something with the intention of making their lives better.”
- “Don’t stop experimenting. Be open to trying something new and seeing how you feel about it. Most importantly, if you are going to do something that’s different from the norm, think about how it’s going to impact someone else.”
  - Think about needs of your team and your family
- “Forcing me to work 9-5 signals to me that they don’t trust me to work in the way that I feel I can be productive. They don’t trust me to make decisions in the best interest of this business and my own life.”
  - Even if it’s remote, even if it’s in his own time zone: no
- “I really enjoy half the company being asleep when I wake up.”

- 4 days a week, 10-7, Central european time
- Noticed that he needed to cut things back to keep things sustainable and effective and efficient
- “Work time is a little like closet space in a house–if you have it, you’re going to use it. Whether you use it for things that matter, that’s a different story.” 4 day work week constrains him to make better decisions with time
- “You get a very good reset out of a three day weekend.” “When I do get to my holiday, I’m not crawling like I used to.”
- More sustainability, more energy
- “If you notice things that don’t work, let’s talk about it.” “The team didn’t actually notice a change with me being able to support them in four days.”
- Doesn’t read slack while off work, team respects his time off, not a lot that piles up
- “This doesn’t feel like part time to me. It feels like full time compressed.”
- “Input hours are a bad metric for any sort of efficiency.”
- “Time spent at desk is the worst measure of efficiency in software engineering. I literally don’t care what hours my reports are working. I just care about output.”
- “There’s a lot of intangibles when it comes to producitivyr in engineering.” Time can be tracked, one of few things, can become KPI
- Blocks extended no meeting time slots, Wednesday from morning to 3 PM
- “If I don’t make sure those are blocked out, my output will suffer.”
- “It’s all about making sure you get at least four back to back uninterrupted focus hours twice a week, cause otherwise you won’t get anything significant done.”
- The right culture is “super necessary”
- “No expectation for where a person is located and how they’re going to structure their day in their location of choice.”
- You don’t need to tell people when they step away from desk SEE HANDBOOK
- “You need some face time to build a human connection.” You will need some overlap
- “Minimum viable guaranteed availability” is for your team to decide. Outside of that window, work should be entirely flexible
- “You can never consider your calendar set. It’s a constantly evolving beast.”
- “Don’t overthink it until you’re familiar with the nature of your job.” Understand time commitment necessary to be efficient, do you need 3 hour focus blocks? 30 minute increments? Do you mind interrupted time? Identify the important things you need to deliver to meet your SLAs and feel efficient
- “Look at what you need to deliver for your job and what do you want out of your schedule outside of your job and ask: how do I put those things together?”
- If you want to surf, work 6-2 and put meetings in one day
- “Remember that it’s a fluid thing. Whatever you do can be reverted.”
- “I doubt that it would be my dream job if it’s completely inflexible. In our industry, if you’re inflexible, you’re ignoring how we actually work and how software actually gets produced. Software is not something that gets produced on an inflexible schedule. I would have doubts as to this company’s understanding of its delivery if they were completely inflexible.”
- “It all sounds neat and appealing. But it still gets messy sometimes. These are general principles I follow but sometimes life gets in the way or I won’t follow my own principles. Don’t feel bad if you do find yourself working a little more.”

TJ

- 4 10s Monday through Thursday, 8-6, might put in an evening shift if something happens during afternoon
- Streams on Friday, live coding, open source work
- Neovim and popular plugins related, maintainer for
- Knew he wanted to do it since starting
- “It’s hard to get any serious work done in 15 minute chunks. I need to sit down for fours to get anything meaningful accomplished and it needs to be four hours in a row.”
- 11 month baby boy, wife, church: can’t do stuff on weeknights
- “Start work a little earlier and end a little later”
- “My preferred hours would be working in the middle of the night but that doesn’t work with a family.”
- “As long as the team feels like it’s not a big detriment to them” then he had manager’s support
- Easier to find meeting times because he’s at work for longer spans of time, especially with Europeans or West Coasters
- He does look at Slack but only because there’s a meme channel
- Exploring Tuesday through Thursday always schedule block in the middle of the day where baby is up from nap and then he works nights
- “I could work in the middle of the night for two nights a week and if I ship all the same amount of stuff, I don’t think people would care.” Though they might reach out about his health
- “No one cares about how you’re working as long as you’re getting done what you say you’re going to get done.”
- “You want to pick something where you could build a habit you can like.” Especially working remote where it can feel like you’re working all the time
- “Working 9-5 can be a good strategy because you know you can do it, you know you like it.”
- “Think of things that you like to do and see how you can fit your schedule around those so they’re pleasant to do.”
- Gets up at 6 to play basketball
- As long as your team is on board, try new schedule for two weeks and see what happens
  - “It’s unlikely that you’ll know the optimal schedule ahead of time. That’s not usually how we find the best version of something. We iterate on it over time.”
- “Sourcegraph is really good at making you feel good about how you’re working.”
- “There’s a very big difference between tolerating someone on your team working weird hours and being like ‘TJ works Monday through Thursday and that’s cool!’” Doesn’t feel weird about his schedule, no one makes him feel weird, didn’t need to negotiate it into employment and no one feels resentful

Stephen

- Regularly has people coming to him for random one off things via slack and google calendar
- “A lot of the time, we don’t have an owner for an area and I’m the person with the most context, so it’s useful for me to help out there.”
- It comes in waves. Over the course of 2 months, 50% of time might go toward helping other people
  - “It’s a weird conundrum because it’s a completely useful way to spend my time. On the other hand, it’s completely unrelated to what my focus area actually is, which is like working on a product feature or something like that.”
  - “It’s all stuff that’s clearly valuable and useful.”
- When there’s a clear consensus about what we should be working, “let me pretend like I’m on vacation for two weeks.” Check in on slack every couple of days but otherwise detach from slack and zoom calls. Focus on goal for that quarter
- “There’s a very strange psychological effect. Are there are any calls today? Does anyone need my help on Slack? Oh… no.” It becomes easy to focus
- “It opens up this situation where you can completely focus and get a lot done.”
- “I know what I need to work on, I just need the time to go and do it. In those situations, detaching from everything else can be really powerful.”
- “I’ll mark myself as on vacation and everything and go off and code.”
- API docs was one engineer team so that made it easy, no one to sync with. Manager only handles high level alignment
- I’m positive there are periods of time where everyone knows what they need to do and has a timeline to do it in.
- “It’s really tempting, as an engineer, to say ‘yeah, this is the main thing I’m working on but oh, this person needs help or someone has a question, let me jump in and help them.’ You can end up losing context a lot of the time.”
- The thing that made him understand this dynamic was when he would go on real vacations and have inspiration. Immense level of focus from vacation. “You can leverage boredom.”
- Takes them ad hoc, when he feels it would be beneficial, when it makes sense to, when he’s not working closely with someone
- “Whenever there’s a time where I’m like ‘hey, I’d love to just sit down and write this code for a while.’”
- “My interest in problem-solving and working is super inconsistent.” He doesn’t wake up every day with the ability to work for eight hours. Sometimes he’s just not feeling it and sometimes he really is.
- “If I feel really productive, then I’ll keep on working. If I don’t, I’ll stop.”
- 4 day work week, Fridays off
  - “The reason for that is on Friday, I’m just not very productive.” Would rather spend an extra hour or so on other days than “mope around on Friday.”
  - “I told my manager I’m not getting anything done on Fridays.”
- “I like to focus on deliverables and getting things done.”
- “Think about the impacts you can have.” You can get lost in giving the appearance of doing work. “At the end of the day, you need to think about what sort of value you’re providing your team and what that looks like. If you laser focus in on that, then nothing else matters.”
- “I would take it as a signal that they care about people in seats and not people producing value.”

Vanesa

- 4 days, not 5 days into four, 8 hours a day, pay cut
- First engineer to go long term part time, until her everything was capped, hers was indefinite
- “I was hired pregnant when I joined Sourcegraph.” Once she had baby and came back from maternity leave, she was affected by brain fog. “I couldn’t focus correctly. I felt like I was constantly deprived, which is literally what happens when you’re a milk factory 24/7.” Felt like she was struggling to code and take care of the baby and household. Weekends weren’t recovery
- “I was exhausted after the weekend.”
- “My code quality declined. My code reviews became longer. It was harder and harder for me to focus properly and reach my goals.”
- Her and engineering manager decided to try out four day work week
- “I can’t imagine going back–especially with the second kid.”
- “On the weekend I get to enjoy my children. It’s not like I’m trying to push them away as I deal with household chores.”
- “I just put it on my calendar. I still need to remind people now and again but it works pretty well.”
- “I don’t know other people with kids do it–unless they have a very supportive or stay at home partner.”
- “I’m happy because when I go, I go. I prefer to work four days through and then have the weekend plus Friday to disconnect and focus on the rest of my life.”
- “Go within and really consider what works for you.”
- “First make a plan for what that new schedule looks like
- “Consider the fact that, realistically, it will slow down your career path a little bit.” One day not available to team will have an effect on your career “one way or the other.” Cost benefits of analysis. Decide if it’s worth it
- “For this phase of my life, while my kids are small and necessary, I need that free day so I can deal with all the mess and be a good parent on the weekend.”
- “If you are struggling with work/life balance, and you need that extra time to practice self care and to deal with all the messes in your life, then it should really be considered.”
- During the pandemic, the biggest collateral in the workforce was mothers.
- Paid maternity leave: “Take care of your family and yourself, and come back when you’ve had your child and you’ve created a new support system.”
- “My team stepped in and said we’re going to take all the work we can. And after two weeks, they said this wasn’t enough and they told me to go. They said ‘You’ll still get your pay, just go.’”
