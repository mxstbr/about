Sourcegraph 3.32 is now available! For this release, we introduced:

## Feature

## Code Insights is available in Public Beta

Code Insights is a new analytics tool that lets you track and understand what’s in your code and how it changes over time. You can find it via “Insights” in the main nav bar. It is free while in beta through 2021. When Code Insights is officially released, we may disable your use of it or charge for using it. We're still polishing Code Insights, so we appreciate if you [share any bugs or feedback about your experience](mailto:feedback@sourcegraph.com).
